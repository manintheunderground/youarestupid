            <p>I get it. Curiosity got to you.<br>
                You now want to know if the random asshole on discord that sent you this website when you asked a stupid question is right.<br>
                Make no mistake, they probably are, but let's make sure.<br>
                You should probably just take an IQ test, but I digress.

            <h1 class="tips-1">Slow learning</h1>
            <img src="rsc/slowlearning.jpg">

            <p>The ability to learn is the cornerstone of intelligence. So less intelligent individuals are? You guessed it, slower learners. <br>
                 Good job, you're not too stupid after all.<br>
                Now, telling whether you're a slow learner or not can be difficult, primarily because we perceive the world at a particular rate and depth,<br>
                so our intelligence might seem normal to us, when sometimes it is not.<br>
                 So this is the best, yet, at the same time, the worst method to find out (by yourself).</p>

            
            <h1 class="">Close mindedness</h1>
            <img src="rsc/closeminded.jpg" alt="">

            <p>Those who are stupid are less likely to be open minded. Shockah, innit? This isn't very surprising because<br>
                to be open minded you first have to understand that there are things that you don't know, something that the<br>
                simpleton may not know. Another barrier the simpleton must break is to have the desire to find out about<br>
                that which he does not understand, and this one is even harder for them to break because they understand slower,<br>
                so a lot of times they're too lazy.</p>

            <h1 class="">Connection with others</h1>
            <img src="rsc/friends.jpg" class="Connection-with-others"">

            <p>The more (unfortunately?) intelligent individuals are less likely to connect with their peers for two reasons:<br><br>
            1. Since their peers are cognitvely slower he or she might feel like they can't catch up fast enough, <br>
            And that he or she will probably get upset that they have to dumb a lot of things down.<br><br>
        
            2. Their peers will probbaly not share the same interests. And even if they do reason 1 will be a bummer.<br><br>
        
            If you've never had these problems then you're not in luck today, my friend.</p>

            <h1 class="">Uncreative</h1>
            <img src="rsc/creative.jpg" class="creative">

            <p>Creativity requires you to be more cognitvely competent because creative ideas are novel.</p>
