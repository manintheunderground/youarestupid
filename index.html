            <p class="stupid-intro">You probably just said something <span class="fucking-span">fucking</span> <span class="stupid-span">stupid</span>.</p>

            <h1>So... how do I know if I'm stupid?</h1>

            <p>Generally, dumb people are too dumb to question if they're dumb.<br> 
                And so, naturally, they do not believe they are.<br>
                That means that one way to find out if you're stupid is to ask yourself:<br>
                Do I think I'm smart?<br>
                 This is called the Dunning-Kruger effect.<br>
                Here's an image cause it's probably too many words for your brain:</p>

            <p>You can find out if you are a simpleton <a href="findout.html">here</a>.</p>

        <div class="manual">
            <h1>Oh no! What do I do?!</h1>

            <p>Not to worry, I have made a manual for simpletons just like you :].<br>
                No, not too many words this time LOL. I know they can confuse you.</p>
